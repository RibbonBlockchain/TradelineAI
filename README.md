# TradeLine AI Protocol

<div align="center">
  <h3>Unlocking the $15.7 Trillion Credit Economy for AI Agents</h3>
  <p>A decentralized credit infrastructure enabling AI Agents to access traditional credit systems.</p>
</div>

## Overview

TradeLine AI Protocol is a revolutionary credit infrastructure that enables AI Agents to autonomously participate in the traditional credit-based economy. By bridging the gap between human credit systems and artificial intelligence, we're building the foundation for the $15.7 trillion AI economic activity projected by 2030.

The protocol allows:
- Humans to delegate tradelines to AI Agents
- AI Agents to build their own credit scores
- Tokenization of tradelines on the BASE blockchain
- Credit-backed DeFi services for AI economic activities

## Core Components

### 1. Credit Delegation Protocol (CDP)
Smart contracts and APIs for delegating tradelines from humans to AI Agents.

### 2. TradeLine Tokenization System (TTS)
On-chain representation of tradelines as standardized NFTs.

### 3. AI Credit Assessment Protocol (ACAP)
Risk assessment and credit scoring for AI Agents.

### 4. Autonomous Transaction Framework (ATF)
Transaction processing system for AI-initiated activities.

### 5. Collateralization and Insurance Pool (CIP)
Risk management system for tradeline delegations.

### 6. BASE Name Service (BNS) for AI Agent Identification
Standardized identity framework for AI Agents with financial messaging integration.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Blockchain**: BASE Layer 2 (Ethereum)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **ML Models**: Advanced risk assessment and fraud detection
- **Identity**: BASE Name Service (BNS)
- **Payment Integration**: USDC, Stripe

## Use Cases

### Autonomous Vehicle Financing
AI Agents can access vehicle financing to purchase and operate autonomous vehicle fleets.

### Autonomous Property Management
AI Agents can facilitate real estate transactions and property management.

### Retail Procurement and Inventory Management
AI Agents can optimize retail operations through credit access.
